## RCarb `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

* Dummy

## RCarb 0.1.3 (2019-06-02)

### New features 
* The reference dataset got a new dataset called `Reference_Data$DR_conv_factors` to support 
different dose rate conversion factors
* The function `model_DoseRate()` gained are new argument `DR_conv_factors` to support 
different dose rate conversion factors

### Bugfixes

* In case values for U-238 and U-234 were provided, for the gamma-dose rate contribution, 
erroneously the beta-dose water correction factors were used; 
now corrected (internal function `.calc_DoseRata()`). This bug already existed in *Carb* and was probably introduced by copy & paste actions. 

### Other modifications

* Add README.md
* Modify output graphics and add more information
* Update dependency and package version requirements

## RCarb 0.1.2 (2018-12-02)
