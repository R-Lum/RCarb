## RCarb 0.1.5 (2022-02-18)

**This update requires R \>= 4.0**

-   Update internal tests to support `'testthat'` \>=3.0
-   Address a CRAN request concerning the logo of RCarb.

## RCarb 0.1.4 (2020-09-15)

### Bugfixes and changes

-   This version of the package requires R \>= 3.5.0
-   If an external dataset was used, the `model_DoseRate()` sometimes
    did not display the sample id correctly in the terminal output;
    corrected.
-   `model_DoseRate()` gained a new argument `par_local`, which is
    `TRUE` by default. If set to `FALSE` all global par settings are
    accepted.

## RCarb 0.1.3 (2019-06-02)

### New features

-   The reference dataset got a new dataset called
    `Reference_Data$DR_conv_factors` to support different dose rate
    conversion factors
-   The function `model_DoseRate()` gained are new argument
    `DR_conv_factors` to support different dose rate conversion factors

### Bugfixes

-   In case values for U-238 and U-234 were provided, for the gamma-dose
    rate contribution, erroneously the beta-dose water correction
    factors were used; now corrected (internal function
    `.calc_DoseRata()`). This bug already existed in *Carb* and was
    probably introduced by copy & paste actions.
