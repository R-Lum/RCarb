The **R** package `'RCarb'` provides a collection of various R functions to model dose rates in carbonate-rich samples. The package is a translation of the `'MATLAB'` program *Carb* by Roger P. Nathan.

## Installation of the developer version

To install the latest development builds of `'RCarb'` directly from GitHub, run

```r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RCarb@master")
```

To install a developer build other than `'master'`, replace the term `'master'` in the code line by the name of the wanted developer build (not available yet). 

Please further note that our 'GitHub' versions are developer versions and subject to daily changes. For stable please versions download the package from  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RCarb).
