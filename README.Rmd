The **R** package 'RCarb' provides a collection of various R functions to model dose rates
in carbonate-rich samples. The package is a translation of the 'MATLAB' program *Carb* by Roger P. Nathan.

## Installation of the developer version

To install the latest development builds of 'RCarb' directly from GitHub, run

```r
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RCarb@master")
```

To install a developer build other than 'master', replace the term 'master' in the codeline by the name
of the wanted developer build (not available yet). 

Please further note that this version is a development version and may change day by day. 
For stable branches please visit the package on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RCarb).
